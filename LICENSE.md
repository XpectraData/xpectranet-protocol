## 🧬 Symbolic Licensing Philosophy

This license protects **meaning** — not just media.

It is designed to:
- Prevent extraction of cognitive structure into closed systems
- Encourage ritual-aligned cognition, not just reuse
- Maintain symbolic coherence across time, trails, and agents

> This is not a copyright license.  
> This is a ritual permission system.
