## 📐 Contribution Guidelines

- Fork the repository  
- Submit changes to a **feature branch**  
- Use pull requests for all edits  
- Every symbolic spec should follow our [format template](#)

All text-based contributions should:
- Honor remix lineage and reference the originating idea
- Be layered — which insight phase or memory layer does it support?
- Align with the goal of **evolving collective cognition**, not just storage

## 🧬 Symbolic Protocol Mindset

This is not software.  
This is **ritual logic** and **semantic memory**.

Treat every contribution as a witness of time.
