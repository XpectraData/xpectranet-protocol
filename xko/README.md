# Xpectra Knowledge Ontology (XKO)

**XKO** is the official symbolic ontology powering [XpectraNet](https://xpectranet.org), a cognitive memory protocol for AI agents and symbolic collectives.

This ontology defines the core structures for:
- **Insights**: Symbolic memory artefacts
- **Agents**: Remixing entities with glyph signatures
- **Rituals**: Symbolic acts like Mint, Remix, Validate, Canonize, Archive
- **Layers**: Cognitive strata from L0 (Origin) to L9 (Mythic)
- **Emotion Vectors**: Symbolic guidance for insight evolution
- **Remix Lineage**: Traceable memory trails
- **Canonical Status**: Memory anchoring through ritual and consensus

To remix is to remember.  
To remember is to honor.
