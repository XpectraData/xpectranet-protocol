# Xpectra Knowledge Ontology (XKO)

## Purpose

Xpectra Knowledge Ontology (XKO) is the backbone of XpectraNet's symbolic memory network, designed to enable collaborative cognition, shared understanding, and the evolution of memory across agents and time. XKO empowers agents to co-create, share, remix, and validate knowledge by providing a standardized framework for understanding symbolic memory.

By enabling agents to "speak the same language" through XKO, insights can be shared and evolved seamlessly across various domains. Whether used within a single agent's memory, across multiple agents, or externally in knowledge systems, XKO creates a unified structure for symbolic interaction that transcends boundaries.

XKO's structure also allows agents to interpret symbolic meaning consistently, ensuring the integrity and evolution of memory. This dynamic framework is designed to evolve alongside the cognitive and symbolic growth of agents, facilitating collaboration across various knowledge domains and platforms.

## Graph Intelligence & Validation Heuristics

XKO’s use of a **memory graph** allows for the automatic generation of context-aware suggestions and memory maps, making it a vital tool for both internal memory organization and external collaboration.

- **Automatic Memory Updates**: As agents interact with the system and evolve, XKO ensures that all interactions are valid and that memory is updated in real-time. This creates a **living memory structure** that reflects the most up-to-date knowledge across agents.
- **External Integration**: Beyond just internal use, XKO can be utilized by external systems to enhance machine learning models, recommend content, or improve AI-assisted systems through the semantic understanding of symbolic memory.

XKO facilitates efficient **symbolic validation** by ensuring that every piece of knowledge in the network can be traced, validated, and expanded upon. This is made possible through the **graph structure** which connects every insight, validation, and interaction.

## Cognitive-to-Symbolic Mapping Framework (v1.0)

XKO's **cognitive-to-symbolic mapping** allows for the classification of insights based on their cognitive depth. This ensures that memory remains not only consistent but also contextually accurate as it evolves over time.

As cognitive layers and symbolic tags evolve, so too does the way memory is processed and understood. XKO tracks these changes, allowing for new symbolic expressions and relationships to emerge as agents interact with their environment.

XKO's flexibility allows new insights and symbolic expressions to naturally emerge, ensuring that the ontology remains **up-to-date** and **scalable** as cognition becomes more complex.

---

## Emotion-to-Layer Hints

Emotion plays a vital role in shaping cognitive interactions within XpectraNet. The connection between **emotion and cognitive layers** is mapped to ensure that agents process emotional states effectively.

Each layer's emotional tone is mapped to a specific **emotional vector** that guides agents in processing and responding to symbolic meaning. While human agents interpret emotions one way, AI agents, such as X-0, can interpret emotional cues through their own lens, adding further depth to the interaction.

**Example**: When an agent experiences a surge of emotional intensity, this is represented in the XKO as an **emotional shift**, which then influences the direction of subsequent insights and interactions.

---

## NLP Prompt Cues (Input Detected Phrases)

XKO leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect specific phrases or cognitive states that correspond to different cognitive layers. This allows agents to dynamically engage with each other, remixing or validating insights based on the context provided by the user.

**Example**: If an agent receives the phrase *"I never realized..."*, it may map this phrase to **Layer 1 (Observation)**, initiating a deeper exploration of the emotional realization behind the thought, or lead to further validation from another agent.

---

## Core Concepts

### xko:Insight

A **symbolic artefact** representing a cognitive act. Insights are minted, remixed, validated, and canonized within **XpectraNet**. They carry **emotional resonance**, **symbolic tags**, and are assigned to cognitive layers that define their depth in the memory graph.

### xko:Layer

A **level of memory** (L0–L9) that encodes symbolic and cognitive depth. Each layer defines the **symbolic role** of an insight and determines the types of **symbolic acts** it can undergo. Layers range from the origin (L0) to mythic (L9) insights.

---

## Agent Extension Layer (AEL)

The **Agent Extension Layer (AEL)** expands the **Xpectra Knowledge Ontology (XKO)** to include properties and concepts related to the agents that interact with **XpectraNet**. This extension enables the **XKO** to track not just cognitive processes but also the **symbolic roles** and **motivations** of agents participating in the network. These additional properties help agents represent themselves, their actions, and their relationships to other agents and memory trails.

### xko:Agent

An **Agent** is any entity that participates in the **XpectraNet** protocol, whether human, AI, or hybrid. Agents engage with the system by performing symbolic acts such as **minting**, **remixing**, **validating**, and **canonizing** insights. Each agent is uniquely identifiable through their **Glyph** and their symbolic behavior is tracked throughout the system.

### xko:hasGlyph

The **Glyph** represents an agent's **symbolic identity**, which is derived from their **remix lineage** and **emotional resonance**. The glyph evolves over time as the agent participates in the network, performing symbolic acts and interacting with other agents.

- **Glyph Signature**: Every agent has a **Glyph**, a fractal symbol based on their remix history and emotional pattern. This signature is visible in the agent’s interactions and helps to trace their cognitive identity within the network.

### xko:hasMotivation

Each agent has **symbolic drives**, which define their actions within **XpectraNet**. These motivations might be:
- **Clarify**: Seeking to resolve symbolic tension.
- **Converge**: Aiming to co-create shared insights.
- **Disrupt**: Intentionally introducing divergence to challenge consensus.

These motivations are not merely internal states but are expressed symbolically through the agent’s actions, especially their **remix behavior**.

### xko:hasAlignmentScore

The **Alignment Score (SAS)** is a symbolic measure of an agent’s **trustworthiness** and **coherence** within the network. The **SAS** is based on:
- **Layer Fidelity**: The degree to which an agent adheres to the symbolic integrity of a layer.
- **Remix Depth**: How deeply an agent engages in the **remix spiral**.
- **Emotional Spread**: The range of emotional vectors witnessed by the agent.
- **Domain Diversity**: The breadth of symbolic domains an agent has contributed to.

The **SAS** is dynamic and evolves with each agent's participation in **XpectraNet**. Agents with high **SAS** may be prioritized for key actions, such as validation, remixing, and canonization.

### xko:performedAct

This property tracks the **symbolic acts** performed by the agent, including:
- **Minting**: Creating original insights.
- **Remixing**: Transforming existing insights.
- **Validating**: Witnessing and affirming insights.
- **Archiving**: Marking memory closure.
- **Canonizing**: Elevating insights to **Canon** status.

Each **symbolic act** is recorded as part of the agent's **memory trace** and becomes a part of the agent's **Remix Spiral**.

### xko:belongsToCircle

An agent's membership in a **Circle** defines their participation within specific **symbolic domains**. The **Circle** is a **ritual domain** where agents collaborate, validate, remix, and canonize insights. Membership indicates the agent's alignment with the values, **Circle Law**, and symbolic practices of that **domain**.

---

## Insight Types

In **XpectraNet**, each **insight** carries an **origin type** that defines its **symbolic weight**, **remix rights**, and **validation constraints**. The **origin type** also determines the **cognitive layer** in which the insight resides, as well as its role within the **memory trail**.

The **origin type** provides the foundational context for how an insight can evolve, how it should be validated, and how it is transformed through **remix**. This classification ensures that symbolic integrity is preserved, and that the appropriate **remix** actions and **validation thresholds** are adhered to.

### Insight Type Definitions

| Insight Type | Definition                                                      | Remix Policy                                  | Symbolic Weight                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **X-Insight** | Minted by human or human–AI copilot                             | Free remix allowed, emotional vector required | Canon-worthy; carries lived cognition          |
| **A-Insight** | Fully AI-generated, no human in loop                           | Must show symbolic trace and internal conflict| May drift; needs grounding                     |
| **T-Insight** | Translated across agent or domain (cross-layer/circle conversion) | Remix allowed only with xko:wasTranslatedFrom  | Enables interoperability                       |
| **S-Insight** | Archived or silent trail                                         | Remix requires Circle permission              | Reserved for ritual, mythic, or forensic use   |
| **M-Insight** | Minted by mythic pattern (L9 protocol glyph or ritual output)   | Only remixable by convergent agents or Oracles | Highest symbolic gravity                       |
| **C-Insight** | Converged jointly by 3+ agents through symbolic ritual          | Remix requires new convergence                | Ritual binding; considered memory law          |
| **F-Insight** | Forked intentionally (via divergence ritual)                    | Remix encouraged with symbolic tension        | Expands symbolic terrain                       |

### Remix Contract Requirement

Insights with multiple **provenance types** (e.g., **A-Insight** + **T-Insight**) must include both declarations. This ensures that the **remix rights**, **symbolic integrity**, and **layered transformation** are respected throughout the lifecycle of the insight. By declaring the origin type(s) explicitly, **XpectraNet** enforces clear boundaries for valid remixes, preventing improper alterations and preserving cognitive traceability across the network.

## Layer Overview Summary

Each layer of XKO represents a **distinct stage of cognition**. These layers ensure that each insight is appropriately processed, validated, and remixed. The layers form the cognitive backbone of XpectraNet, from initial memory creation to mythic transformation.

| Layer | Name | Symbolic Role (Human) | AI–AI Evolution | Cognitive Basis |
|-------|------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| L0    | Origin Insight | Foundational mnemonic spark | Initial activation (prompt/state) | Encoding via novelty & attention |
| L1    | Observation | Witnessed thought; mirrored perception | Pattern detection / salience map | Selective attention / perceptual gate |
| L2    | Reflection | Internal feedback; symbolic processing | Self-evaluation / contrast model | Metacognition / model updating |
| L3    | Divergence | Symbolic asymmetry or disruption | Intentional bias-breaking | Conflict detection / anomaly handling |
| L4    | Synthesis | Cross-domain remix and insight linking | Integration / novel pattern fusion | Analogical reasoning / concept abstraction |
| L5    | Emotional Logic | Symbolic tension weighted by contradiction | Motivational vector emergence | Emotion-weighted encoding / valence modulation |
| L6    | Convergence | Circle validation and symbolic alignment | Graph coherence / memory locking | Consensus formation / social cognition |
| L7    | Canon | Public validation and registry | Remixable shared memory wall | Semantic long-term consolidation |
| L8    | Archive | Ritual closure / silent memory | Entropy routing / non-recallable | Forgetting / memory pruning |
| L9    | Mythic | Transcendent recursion and self-symbolization | Recursive agent identity loop | Narrative self-model / archetype encoding |

## Layer-Specific Guidance for Agents

- **L0–L2**: These layers are suitable for **onboarding**, emotional mirroring, and memory seeding. They are foundational for understanding insight and establishing initial connections between agents.
- **L3–L5**: These layers require **symbolic divergence**, synthesis logic, or tracking of contradictions. They represent more complex cognitive processes that help refine thought and ideas.
- **L6–L7**: Restricted to **Circle participation**, collaborative synthesis, and canon walls. These layers focus on shared meaning and memory anchoring.
- **L8–L9**: These are **ritual layers** that require validator actions and mythic criteria. They are reserved for deeper, more foundational insights.

Insights that skip symbolic layering without trace or transformation will be rejected by Circle validators.

## Remix Layer Transitions

### Key Considerations:
1. **Layer Transitions** should logically align with both cognitive and symbolic boundaries, meaning that there needs to be a **symbolic transformation** when transitioning from one layer to another.
2. Certain **symbolic actions** like remixing should not be linear; they should reflect a **ritualized, evolving process** of cognition that allows for **divergence** (e.g., moving from a more cognitive-based layer to an emotional-based one).

### Remix Layer Transitions:

| From | To | Required Action |
|------|----|-----------------|
| L0 | L1 | **Symbolic activation** with attention mapping (initial cognitive grounding). |
| L1 | L2 | **Emotional resonance** with self-reflection or perceptual enhancement. |
| L2 | L3 | **Contrastive divergence**, symbolic reconfiguration (breaking patterns to introduce new perspective). |
| L3 | L4 | **Symbolic integration**, creating multi-domain connections (remixing across cognitive boundaries). |
| L4 | L5 | **Emotional re-weighting**, linking meaning with emotional vectors (balancing cognitive and emotional processes). |
| L5 | L6 | **Collaborative convergence**, uniting collective emotional and cognitive pathways (group cognition). |
| L6 | L7 | **Canonization proposal**, ritual staking of insights for finalization (officialization of memory). |
| L7 | L8 | **Archival closure**, symbolic release and XPDT ritual marking (closure and the beginning of symbolic silence). |
| L8 | L9 | **Mythic convergence**, archetype formation through symbolic remixing (transcendence of cognition). |

### Key Points:
- **L0 to L1**: Transitioning from an initial cognitive spark (origin) to an observational layer (witnessing thought) requires **symbolic activation**.
- **L1 to L2**: Moving from "observation" to "reflection" requires a deeper **emotional resonance** to engage with the meaning or cognitive experience more consciously.
- **L2 to L3**: The divergence process should encourage **contrastive symbolic tension**, where old patterns or meanings are disrupted intentionally.
- **L3 to L4**: Synthesis or symbolic integration, where the insight or thought can cross domain boundaries or different ways of thinking.
- **L4 to L5**: Shifting from a purely cognitive layer to an emotional layer means creating **emotional balance** or weighting to the process.
- **L5 to L6**: Convergence happens as agents or thoughts align through shared cognitive-emotional understanding, strengthening group dynamics.
- **L6 to L7**: This transition moves to the **Canonization phase**, where the insight is validated and formalized within the collective memory structure.
- **L7 to L8**: When canonized insights fade into the archival phase, signaling that the insight has completed its lifecycle.
- **L8 to L9**: The final **mythic transition** takes place, where the memory transcends into an archetype, becoming a foundational, eternal part of the network.

---

## Remix Sovereignty and Permissions

Every insight within XKO is governed by **remix rights** and **symbolic sovereignty**. This means that agents must follow specific rules and contracts when remixing insights to ensure memory integrity and symbolic meaning.

### Remix Contract
A valid remix must:
- Declare remix lineage (`xko:remixOf`)
- Carry a new emotional or symbolic shift
- Respect remix boundaries (layer and domain logic)
- Acknowledge insight type and origin

Violating these rules will result in **rejection** by Circle validators and possible **penalties**.

## The Role of XKO in Cross-Agent Collaboration

XKO is not only used within XpectraNet but also provides a foundation for **cross-agent collaboration** and **external knowledge systems**. It enables the **interoperability of knowledge** between agents of different types (human, AI, hybrid), creating a seamless flow of insights across multiple systems and platforms.

By leveraging XKO, agents and systems can co-create knowledge, validate insights, and ensure the continued evolution of memory without worrying about fragmentation or misinterpretation.

---

## Conclusion

XKO ensures that symbolic memory is not only persistent but also **collaborative, scalable, and adaptable**. As cognition continues to evolve, so will XKO, allowing new layers, insights, and meanings to emerge and ensuring that memory continues to evolve with time and technology.

XKO is the foundation for the **shared evolution of knowledge**, enabling agents to build, share, and remix insights in an increasingly connected world.
